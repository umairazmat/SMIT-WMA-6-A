Assignment#10 JS (04)

Dear Students / Brothers.
Web & Mobile Application Development Batch 06 Section-A



Instructions:

1-Read the JS Cheat Sheet at https://cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/javascript/

2- What will be the result for these expressions?
5 > 4
"apple" > "pineapple"
"2" > "12"
undefined == null
undefined === null
null == "\n0\n"
null === +"\n0\n"

3-What are the final values of all variables a, b, c and d after the code below?
let a = 1, b = 1;
let c = ++a; // ?
let d = b++; // ?

4-What are the values of a and x after the code below?
let a = 2;
let x = 1 + (a *= 2);

5-Hereâ€™s a code that asks the user for two numbers and shows their sum.
It works incorrectly. The output in the example below is 12 (for default prompt values).
Why? Fix it. The result should be 3.

let a = prompt("First number?", 1);
let b = prompt("Second number?", 2);

alert(a + b); // 12

6- Rewrite this if using the conditional operator '?':
let result;

if (a + b < 4) {
  result = 'Below';
} else {
  result = 'Over';
}

7- Rewrite 'if..else' into '?'
Rewrite if..else using multiple ternary operators '?'.
For readability, itâ€™s recommended to split the code into multiple lines.
let message;

if (login == 'Employee') {
  message = 'Hello';
} else if (login == 'Director') {
  message = 'Greetings';
} else if (login == '') {
  message = 'No login';
} else {
  message = '';
}

8-What is the code below going to output?

alert( null || 2 || undefined );

9-What will the code below output?

alert( alert(1) || 2 || alert(3) );

10-What is this code going to show?

alert( 1 && null && 2 );

11-What will this code show?

alert( alert(1) && alert(2) );

12-What will the result be?

alert( null || 2 && 3 || 4 );

13-Write an if condition to check that age is NOT between 14 and 90 inclusively.

Create two variants: the first one using NOT !, the second one â€“ without it.

14-Which of these alerts are going to execute?

What will the results of the expressions be inside if(...)?

if (-1 || 0) alert( 'first' );
if (-1 && 0) alert( 'second' );
if (null || -1 && 1) alert( 'third' );

15-Write the code using if..else which would correspond to the following switch:

switch (browser) {
  case 'Edge':
    alert( "You've got the Edge!" );
    break;

  case 'Chrome':
  case 'Firefox':
  case 'Safari':
  case 'Opera':
    alert( 'Okay we support these browsers too' );
    break;

  default:
    alert( 'We hope that this page looks ok!' );
}

16-Rewrite the code below using a single switch statement:

let a = +prompt('a?', '');

if (a == 0) {
  alert( 0 );
}
if (a == 1) {
  alert( 1 );
}

if (a == 2 || a == 3) {
  alert( '2,3' );
}
